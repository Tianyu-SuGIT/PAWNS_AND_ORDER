### Overview

PAWNS is a multiplayer strategy game for 4-6 players where you must outsmart your opponents to score the most points over 5 rounds. Every choice is a strategic dilemma as you try to predict your opponents' moves while secretly pursuing your own goals.

### How to Play

**The Goal:** Be the player with the most points at the end of 5 rounds.

**Gameplay:**
- Each round, all players simultaneously choose a square from 1 to 12 on the game board.
- Your choice is driven by two types of objectives:

    - **Common Objective:** A public goal that applies to all players. This creates points of conflict and tension on the board.
    - **Personal Objective:** A secret goal unique to you. This might involve landing on a specific number, positioning yourself relative to another player, or even sabotaging someone else's plans.

**Scoring and Conflicts:**
- The most important rule: **If you end a round on the same square as another player, you generally score no points for that round!**
- You must carefully balance the risk of competing for a valuable public objective against the safer path of completing your secret one.
- Pay attention! Some objectives can break the rules and might even reward players for being on the same square.

**Key Features:**
- **Reroll:** You have one chance per game to discard your personal objective and get a new one. Use it wisely!
- **Timed Rounds:** Each round has a 3-minute timer to keep the pressure on.
- **Chat:** Use the in-game chat to negotiate, bluff, or mislead your opponents.
